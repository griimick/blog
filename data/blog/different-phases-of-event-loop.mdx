## A little about Node.js

Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime. It operates on a single-threaded event loop, using non-blocking I/O calls which allows it to support many concurrent connections without incurring the cost of context switching. This is in contrast to a more common concurrency model, where each connection is handled by a relatively heavyweight OS process or thread.

Node.js uses libuv as an abstraction layer over different I/O polling mechanisms, cross-platform file I/O, threading functionality, and much more for its event-driven asynchronous I/O model. Take a look at its feature list and see what this unicorn is all about.
