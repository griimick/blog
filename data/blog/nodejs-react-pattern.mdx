summary: 'Looking into Node.js internal architecture for its Reactor Pattern implementation'

Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime. It operates on a single-threaded event loop, using non-blocking I/O calls which allows it to support many concurrent connections without incurring the cost of context switching. This is in contrast to a more common concurrency model, where each connection is handled by a relatively heavyweight OS process or thread.

Some points to know before we look deeper into the internals,

1. Javascript is a strictly synchronous language. All lines of code are executed sequentially in order just like C or Java or Python.
2. Actual events that a node.js application waits on requires no looping at all for updates. In fact it requires ~0% CPU tim
   e.
3. The word _handler_ is from the time when interrupts were invented, introducing asynchronous opertion in computers at a hardware level. Interrupts was introduced to speed up I/O operations by eliminating the need to poll some input with software in an infinite loop—taking CPU time away from useful work—and letting the hardware send a signal to the CPU to tell it that an event has occurred. The CPU then suspends the currently running program and execute another program to handle the interrupt—we ended up calling those functions _interrupt handlers_.
4. There are two types of I/O, namely, Synchronous I/O and Asynchronous I/O. Former blocks your requesting thread at multiple places and later blocks only at one place where your thread is waiting for events.
