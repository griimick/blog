# Blog

Source code to my blog at [blog.soumik.dev](https://blog.soumik.dev/). 

# Why

Main intent behind this was to get hands-on with Next.js and understand the hype behind many different ways of rendering in web. Decided to use [Tailwind Nextjs Theme](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) as starting template to jump start.

Also, reading [this](https://sid.st/post/start-a-blog/) changed my perspective regarding sharable blog content.
